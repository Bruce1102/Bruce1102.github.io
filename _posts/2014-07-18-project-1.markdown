description: "Stochastic processes such as Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), and Heston models are commonly used in the world of quantitative finance. Mathematicians have won nobel prizes for inventing these stochastic models. However, fitting them to a given data set is also a difficult task. In this project, I have utilised multiple statistical methods to fit a model to a given historical data set, such as Method of Moments (MM), Least Squares Method (LSM), and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).<br><br>This project can be accessed through the following <a href='https://github.com/Bruce1102/Stochastic-Process-Fitting'>github link</a>."
