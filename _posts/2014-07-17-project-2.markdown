description: "The 'Exotic Options Pricing' project delves into the intricate world of exotic options, pricing them using both Monte Carlo and Finite Difference Methods (FDM). The project covers a variety of exotic options, including Asian, American, Lookback, and Barrier options. Each possessing unique features and payoff conditions, making them more complex than standard options. 


FDM was used to solve Black Scholes PDE, Explicit, Implicit and Crank-Nicolson schemes were implemented. 


Monte Carlo method was used for path dependent options - simulating the underlying stock's price dynamics with a stochastic process, then calculate the discounted fair price. Stochastic processes include Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), Vasicek Model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) Model, Heston Model, and Merton's Jump Diffusion.
